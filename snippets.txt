html {
    // This defines what 1rem is
    font-size: 62.5%; // width 1200-1800
    
    @include breakpoint(max-width $tab-land) { //width < 1200
        font-size: 56.25%; // 1200-18..1rem === 9px | 9/16
    }
    
    @include breakpoint(max-width $tab-port) { //width < 900
        font-size: 50%; // 1rem === 8px | 8/16 = 50%;
    }
    
    @include breakpoint(min-width $big-desktop) { // width > 1800
        font-size: 75%; // 1rem === 12px | 12/16
    }
    
}

GRID:
start with original then update them

add col class to add bottom margins now but only when viewport width is less than 900px

@include breakpoint(max-width $tab-port) {
    [class^="col-"]:not(:last-child) {
        margin-bottom: 3rem;
    }        
}

add a clearfix class to the 2nd col that has the images..when they are floated this is needed:

.section-about .clearfix {
    @include clearfix;
}
